            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                This Privacy Policy applies to the "HR Monitor Peripheral" application (the "App") for Wear OS. This policy describes how the App handles your information. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Data Collection and Usage</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                <strong>The App does not collect, store, save, or transmit any personal data, health data, or any other user information.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The sole function of the App is to read the heart rate data from your watch's built-in sensor and broadcast it locally over the standard Bluetooth Heart Rate Service profile. This process happens entirely on your device. The data is never sent to us or any third party.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Permissions</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                To function correctly, the App requires the following permissions on your Wear OS device:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Body Sensors:</strong> This permission is required to access the heart rate monitor on your watch. The App cannot read your heart rate without it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bluetooth Permissions (Advertise, Connect):</strong> These permissions are necessary for the App to function as a Bluetooth peripheral and broadcast your heart rate data to nearby devices, such as fitness equipment.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Foreground Service:</strong> This permission allows the app to continue running and broadcasting your heart rate even when it is not in the immediate foreground, ensuring a stable connection to your equipment during a workout.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The data accessed via these permissions is used exclusively for the real-time broadcasting feature and is never stored or transmitted off your device by the App.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The App does not use any third-party services, analytics, or advertising networks.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
            </p>
